OTF version of cascadia fonts
=============================

These casks provide cascadia fonts in static otf version instead of dynamic ttf.

The reason it may be useful is because terminals on MacOS don't hint properly with dynamic ttf.

In case the font gets updated:
```
$EDITOR gen-casks
./gen-casks
```
